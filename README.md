## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Step-by-Step Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hybrid-recommendation-engine.git
cd hybrid-recommendation-engine

# 2. Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Launch application
streamlit run app.py
Dependencies

    Data Processing: pandas, numpy, scipy

    Machine Learning: scikit-learn, scikit-surprise

    NLP: nltk, textblob, gensim

    Visualization: plotly, seaborn, matplotlib

    Web Framework: streamlit

🚀 Usage
1. Data Upload

    Upload users.csv and posts.csv files via the Streamlit interface

    Files are automatically validated and processed

2. Data Exploration

    Analyze user demographics and interest distributions

    Visualize post engagement patterns and popularity metrics

    Identify data quality issues and patterns

3. Recommendation Generation

    Select recommendation algorithm (Hybrid, Semantic, or A/B Test)

    Configure weight parameters for different scoring components

    Generate recommendations for specified number of users

4. Analysis & Export

    Review recommendation quality and coverage metrics

    Analyze recommendation patterns and diversity

    Export results as CSV for submission

🧠 Algorithms
🔄 Collaborative Filtering

    Method: User-User K-Nearest Neighbors

    Library: Scikit-Surprise with cosine similarity

    Strength: Discovers patterns from user behavior

    Weakness: Cold start problem for new users

📝 Content-Based Filtering

    Method: TF-IDF Vectorization + Cosine Similarity

    Features: Post title, content, and user interests

    Strength: Effective for new and niche content

    Weakness: Limited to content similarity

⭐ Popularity Scoring

    Method: Normalized like counts with time decay

    Metrics: Like counts, engagement rates

    Strength: Surface trending and quality content

    Weakness: May create popularity bias

🧩 Hybrid Approach

    Formula:
    text

Final_Score = (0.4 × Collaborative) + (0.4 × Content) + (0.2 × Popularity)

    Benefits: Balances personalization with community trends

    Innovation: Automatic weight adjustment based on data availability
